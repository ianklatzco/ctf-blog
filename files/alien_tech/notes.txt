using the emscripten test harness appears to call main with an argc of 1


hm, if i got thru f9 with a partic input, i should go check that CMP to see if it's promising.
	well i tried that, and got browser lag again. what's interesting is that
	it actually appears to be using fd.write, so if i make that a console.log it'll spit things out.
	seems to be two adjacent memlocs.


one of the functions interfaces w N Gonzalez (11) but i'm not sure what it does.
it clearly scans over that memory.

// how can we cause function11 to return 0?
well, the 2nd pushed arg influences it, and it gives a memloc at 8chars but that might be coincidence.

learned: i had some issues figuring out how to pass things to main correctly.
argc == 1 for calls to main without anything.

single-quoting the entire string is fine
